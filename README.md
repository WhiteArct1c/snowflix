## THE SNOWFLIX:
---
<p>
   The Snowflix is a project I did that can show the movies are playing now or in theaters. At the moment, in the snowflix you can see some information about these movies like the synopsis or the rating about it and save it if you want.
</p>

## ABOUT THE PROJECT:
---
<p>
   This is my first project using React, so the objective was to apply my knowledge about React, React Hooks, React Routes (using react-router-dom), Vite JS, AXIOS for the HTTP requests and React Toastify for the alert styles, the movies you saved only stays on the browser's local storage, so at the moment It don't have a database. I decided to deploy this project on the netlify that you can access by clicking on the logo image at the top of this README.
